Introduction / Business Problem

Business Problem: What is the probability that i will get into an car accident and how severe will it be? Are certain conditions more likely to result in an accident?

Target Audience: People that have to drive from point a to point b every day for work. So that they know if it is more dangerous to drive this road that day /
and how long it would take because of possible accidents
Ambulance / Fire Department / Police so they can plan accordingly how to have enough and the right people available to help the injured people.

Data: CSV File about Data Collisions. 30 Columns. 194673 Entries. I will try to build a ml model with the columns: Weather, Light Conditions, Road Conditions, Severity Code,Speeding
Weather: Weather conditions during the collision
Light Condition: Light Condition during the collision
Road Condition: Road Condition during the collision
Speeding: Was speeding a factor in the collision?
Severity Code: 3(Fatality), 2b(serious injury), 2(injury), 1(prop damage), 0(unknown)
The Column Severity Code unfortunately only got 2 different variables in the CSV File. So i have to deal with this issue.
In the Column Speeding are many missing values. So i have to eliminate that column from my model to improve the accuracy.
